# stock Price Prediction with Streamlit
This project is part of my ongoing internship at ecodecamp. The task was to develop a machine learning model that predicts stock prices using data from the Alpha Vantage API. The project is built using Python, and the model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The main components of the project include:

## Data Collection:
Stock data is fetched from the Alpha Vantage API.
## Data Preprocessing: ~
Data is cleaned, scaled, and transformed to prepare it for model training.
## Model Training:
A machine learning model (LSTM) is trained on sequences of stock data to predict future prices.
## Deployment: 
The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing for real-time predictions based on the latest stock data.
## Key Features
### Real-time Stock Data: 
Fetches the latest stock data using Alpha Vantage API.
### Interactive Predictions:
Users can input stock symbols and get predictions on future prices.
### Visualizations: 
Graphical representation of predicted vs actual stock prices.
## Project Structure
predictor.py: Main application file for Streamlit.
train.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training the machine learning model.
model.pkl: Saved model file.
## Challenges and Learnings
This project pushed me out of my comfort zone, especially with deploying the model and handling real-time data. I’m a bit nervous about how it will be received, but also proud of the progress I’ve made. It’s been a great learning experience, thanks to the support and guidance from ecodecamp.
